1. `React.FC` (React Function Component):
   - `React.FC` is a type provided by React that indicates that a component is a function component.
   - It helps TypeScript understand that the component is a function and expects props.
   - By using `React.FC`, you can benefit from TypeScript's type checking and auto-completion for component props.

Example usage:
```typescript
import React from 'react';

interface MyComponentProps {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ name, age }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {name}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

2. `React.ReactNode`:
   - `React.ReactNode` is a type provided by React that represents the possible children (content) of a React component.
   - It can accept various types of values, such as JSX elements, strings, numbers, or fragments.
   - By using `React.ReactNode`, you can define a prop that can receive different types of content as children.

Example usage:
```typescript
import React from 'react';

interface ContainerProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const Container: React.FC<ContainerProps> = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>{children}</div>
  );
};
```

Usage:
```jsx
import Container from './Container';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my App</h1>
      <Container>
        <p>This is some content inside the Container component.</p>
      </Container>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In the above example, the `Container` component is a function component that accepts the `children` prop of type `React.ReactNode`. The `children` prop represents the content passed between the opening and closing tags of the `Container` component. You can pass various types of content to the `children` prop, such as JSX elements, strings, or numbers.
